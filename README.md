# HTML-projects
My HTML projects, maybe very small, but these're what I've done.

## 1.My first HTML project
  It's just a notebook when I'm learning HTML. Maybe you can't understand the video, but that's not the point, it just means i know how to use it.
## 2.(Still making)HTML quick learn
  It'll teach you HTML very quickly. I hope I would done it earlier!
